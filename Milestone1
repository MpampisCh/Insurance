Suggested Milestones (M1):

Initial investigation on the design of the application:
    After understanding the requirements for this Java application, we realise, since it is not given, the need of creation of
    a database (DB) in order to test with some examples the functionality of the application. Also, we had a question 
    if our DB should be online or local and we decide to have it locally.
    
    As it is described at the F1, we notice a case for the user to provide a valid plate’s number but it does not exist in our DB. 
    Then, we handle this with a proper message in order to have the requested functionality.In particular, for the F2 requirement,
    regarding to find which vehicles are about to expire in days, we consider that the solution could be implemented both inside
    the Java application and the DB. Initially, we decide to implement this through our DB, as we found a specific function which
    is named DateDiff.
    
    Finally, we want to avoid asking from user additional information, for example to provide his Last name, we thought
    that we could find it out through the plate’s number which is provided at the first requirement.


Classes to be used:
-InsuranceDBConnection: the class in which we have the DB_Connection for the DB we have created
-Vehicle: includes the constructor of a vehicle
-VehicleEnvironment: reads data for every report  from the DB’s table of vehicles, using jdbc
-VehicleStatus: enums for the two different states of Insurance status
-Owner: includes the constructor of a vehicle
-OwerEnvironment: inside this class there will be the queries concerning the owner
-Functions: implementation of functions that are related to DB, such as checkIfPlateFormatIsRight(),getUninsuredVehiclesInOrder()
-InsuranceApp: includes the main class

User stories:
    F1:
-AS A [USER] I WANT TO [GIVE THE VEHICLE’S PLATES] SO THAT [I CAN BE INFORMED FOR THE INSURANCE STATUS]
-AS A [USER] I WANT TO [PROVIDE A ‘ABC-1234’ FORMAT  FOR A VEHICLE'S PLATES] SO THAT [I CAN GIVE  A VALID RESPONSE]
    F2: 
-AS A [USER] I WANT TO [GIVE A TIME FRAME IN DAYS] SO THAT [I CAN LEARN WHICH VEHICLES ARE ABOUT TO EXPIRE]
-AS A [USER] I WANT TO [CHOOSE THE EXPORT FORMAT] SO THAT [I CAN TAKE THE RESULT AT THE CONSOLE OR AS AN EXPORTED FILE]
    F3:
-AS A [USER] I WANT TO [HAVE A SORTING OF PLATES’ NUMBERS] SO THAT [THE PLATES COULD BE PROVIDED IN ALPHANUMERICAL ORDER]
    F4:
-AS A [USER] I WANT TO [PROVIDE THE FINE FOR AN UNINSURED VEHICLE] SO THAT [I CAN CALCULATE THE TOTAL FINE COST PER OWNER]
